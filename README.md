# Arduino-For-Beginners
This is a repo to represent the lessons I'm taking to learn more about arduino. It is not fully fleshed out or labelled. I'm working on that. I am followng tutorials from Paul McWhorter on youtube, very clear explanations. https://www.youtube.com/c/mcwhorpj link to his channel.
